# Utilities
Precompiled retro computer utilities for:

<li>x86_64 Windows
<li>x86_64 Linux
<li>x86_64 Mac Intel
<li>ARM64 Mac m1

In this repo you´ll find different utilities compiled for both x86_64 Windows and Linux. More utilities will be contantly added so keep an eye out here from time to time. You may, ofcourse, rename the tool and remove the -xxx tail once you downloaded it to your platform. It´s only named like that here in the repo to differentiate between the tools.
