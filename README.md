# Utilities
Precompiled retro computer utilities for:

<li>x86_64 Windows
<li>x86_64 Linux
<li>x86_64 Mac Intel
<li>ARM64 Mac m1

In this repo you´ll find different utilities compiled for both x86_64 Windows, Linux, x86_64 Mac and ARM64 Mac (m1). More utilities will be contantly added so keep an eye out here from time to time. You may, ofcourse, rename the tool and remove the -xxx tail once you downloaded it to your platform. It´s only named like that here in the repo to differentiate between the tools.
